# Evaluate Service

## 1.  Introduction

The model evaluation service is used to evaluate the performance of a model on a specific hardware device, such as the accuracy, model size, and latency of a pruned and quantized model on the Atlas 200 DK.

Currently, the evaluation service supports Davincit inference chips (Atlas 200 DK, ATLAS300, and development board environment Evb) and mobile phones. More devices will be supported in the future.

The evaluation service uses the CS architecture. The evaluation service is deployed on the server. The client sends an evaluation request to the server through the `REST` interface and obtains the result. Vega can use the evaluation service to detect model performance in real time during network architecture search. After a candidate network is generated in the search phase, the network model can be sent to the evaluation service. After the model evaluation is complete, the evaluation service returns the evaluation result to Vega. Vega performs subsequent search based on the evaluation result. This real-time evaluation on the actual device helps to search for a network structure that is more friendly to the actual hardware.

1. Insert the SD card into the card reader and connect the card reader to the USB port on the Ubuntu server.
2. Install dependencies on the Ubuntu server:

    ```bash
    apt-get install qemu-user-static binfmt-support python3-yaml gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
    ```

3. Run the following command to query the name of the USB device where the SD card is located:

    ```bash
    fdisk -l
    ```

4. Run the SD card making script to make a card. The USB device name is the name obtained in the previous step.

    ```bash
    python3 make_sd_card.py  local  USB Device Name
    ```

5. After the card is created, remove the SD card from the card reader, insert the SD card into the card slot of the Atlas 200 DK developer board, and power on the Atlas 200 DK developer board.

#### 3.1.1.3 Installing and Configuring the Evaluation Server Environment

1. Downloading and Installing the DDK Package and Synchronizing the Library

    Download address: <https://www.huaweicloud.com/ascend/resources/Tools/1>
    For details about the installation procedure, see the official document: <https://www.huaweicloud.com/ascend/doc/atlas200dk/1.32.0.0(beta)/zh/zh-cn_topic_0204690657.html>

2. Configuring the Cross Compilation Environment
    To install the compilation environment required by the Atlas 200 DK on the evaluation server, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
    ```

3. Configure the following environment variables in `/etc/profile` of the server. The value of `/home/<user name>` in the file must be a specific path.

    ```bash
    export DDK_PATH=/home/<user name>/huawei/ddk
    export PYTHONPATH=$DDK_PATH/site-packages/te-0.4.0.egg:$DDK_PATH/site-packages/topi-0.4.0.egg
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DDK_PATH/uihost/lib:$DDK_PATH/lib/x86_64-linux-gcc5.4
    export PATH=$PATH:$DDK_PATH/toolchains/ccec-linux/bin:$DDK_PATH/uihost/bin
    export TVM_AICPU_LIBRARY_PATH=$DDK_PATH/uihost/lib/:$DDK_PATH/uihost/toolchains/ccec-linux/aicpu_lib
    export TVM_AICPU_INCLUDE_PATH=$DDK_PATH/include/inc/tensor_engine
    export TVM_AICPU_OS_SYSROOT=/home/<user name>/tools/sysroot/aarch64_Ubuntu16.04.3
    export NPU_HOST_LIB=/home/<user name>/tools/1.32.0.B080/RC/host-aarch64_Ubuntu16.04.3/lib
    export NPU_DEV_LIB=/home/<user name>/tools/1.32.0.B080/RC/host-aarch64_Ubuntu16.04.3/lib
    ```

4. Configuring SSH Mutual Trust
    File transfer and remote command execution are required between the evaluation server and the Atlas 200 DK. Therefore, you need to configure SSH mutual trust in the two environments to ensure that the script can be automatically executed.

    a.  Install the SSH. `sudo apt-get install ssh`
    b.  Generate a key. The `ssh-keygen -t rsa` command generates the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files in the ~/.ssh/ directory. id_rsa.pub is the public key.
    c.  Check the authorized_keys file in the directory. If the file does not exist, create it and run the `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` command to change the permission.
    d.  Copy the public key. Copy the content of the public key id_rsa.pub to the authorized_keys file on another host.
    **Note**: Perform the preceding steps on the evaluation server and Atlas 200 DK separately to ensure SSH trust between the two servers.

### 3.1.2 Installing and Configuring the Atlas 300 Environment (Optional)

For details, see the Huawei official tutorial at <https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/zh/ai-computing-platform/a300-3000-pid-250702915>.

Note: The preceding documents may be updated. Please follow the released updates or obtain the corresponding guide documents. After the environment is installed, you need to set environment variables. For details, see the preceding guide. To facilitate environment configuration, we provide the environment variable configuration template [env_atlas300.sh](https://github.com/huawei-noah/vega/blob/master/evaluate_service/hardwares/davinci/env/env_atlas300.sh) for your reference.

```
4 Installing the ADB Debug Tool  
Reference to section 3.1.3.2.

### 3.2 Installing and Starting the Evaluation Service

1 Installation: Install the vega on the evaluation server, and add the `--no-dependencies` parameter during installation. Do not install dependencies.       
2 Start: Run the `vega-evaluate_service-service -i {your_ip_adress} -w {your_work_path}` command. The `-i` parameter specifies the IP address of the current server and 
the `-w` parameter specifies the working path, please use absolute path. The intermediate files generated during program running are stored in this directory.
For details about other optional parameters, see the help information of this command. Generally, the default values are recommended.

## 4. Use evaluate service

To use evaluate service, you only need to configure a few lines in the configuration file, as shown in the following example.

```yaml
evaluator:
    type: Evaluator
    device_evaluator:
        type: DeviceEvaluator
        hardware: "Davinci"
        remote_host: "http://192.168.0.2:8888"
```

The configuration of `evaluator` is at the same level as your configuration of `trainer`. Two parameters need to be configured. `hardware` indicates the hardware device to be evaluated. Currently, `Davinci` and `Bolt` are supported. `remote_host` indicates the IP address and port number of the evaluation server to be deployed.

## 5. Customizing the Evaluation Service (Optional)

Evaluate service supports devices such as Davinci inference chips and mobile phones. However, new hardware devices are emerging. Therefore, Vega provides customized scalability.

The process of the evaluate service is as follows:

1. obtaining input information
2. Instantiate a specific hardware instance according to the hardware to be evaluated
3. Model conversion
4. inference
5. Return the inference result

Steps 3 and 4 may be different for different hardware. Therefore, when new hardware needs to be added, perform the two steps based on the hardware usage. Specifically, the procedure is as follows:

Add a hardware class to the hardwares directory and implement the `convert_model` and `inference` interfaces as follows:

 ```python
from class_factory import ClassFactory

@ClassFactory.register()
class MyHardware(object):

    def __init__(self, optional_params):
        pass

    def convert_model(self, backend, model, weight, **kwargs):
        pass

    def inference(self, converted_model, input_data, **kwargs):

        return latency, output
```

In the preceding example, the `MyHardware` class is defined and registered through `@ClassFactory.register()`.

The class implements the `convert_model` and `inference` interfaces, `backend` indicates the training framework through which the model is saved, for example, `pytorch` and `tensorflow`, which provide necessary auxiliary information for model parsing. `model` and `weight` indicate the training framework through which the model is saved, respectively.

Model and weight to be converted. The value of weight is optional and may be empty. `converted_model` and `input_data` indicate the converted model and input data, respectively.

Add the class to `__init__.py` of the hardware.

```python
from .my_hardware import MyHardware
```

## 6. FAQ

### 6.1 Pytorch Model Evaluation

The `Pytorch` model needs to be converted on the Appraisal client. Download [PytorchToCaffe](https://github.com/xxradon/PytorchToCaffe) and store it in the `./third_party` directory (the third_party directory and vega directory are at the same directory level).

Note: The third-party open-source software does not support pytorch1.1. If you use the model in the native torchvisoin and the torchvision version is later than 0.2.0, you need to make the following additional modifications:
Add the following content to the `pytorch_to_caffe.py` file:

```python

def _flatten(raw , input, * args):
    x = raw(input, *args)
    if not NET_INITTED:
        return x
    layer_name=log.add_layer(name='flatten')
    top_blobs=log.add_blobs([x],name='flatten_blob')
    layer=caffe_net.Layer_param(name=layer_name,type='Reshape',
                                bottom=[log.blobs(input)],top=top_blobs)
    start_dim = args[0]
    end_dim = len(x.shape)
    if len(args) > 1:
        end_dim = args[1]
    dims = []
    for i in range(start_dim):
        dims.append(x.shape[i])
    cum = 1
    for i in range(start_dim, end_dim):
        cum = cum * x.shape[i]
    dims.append(cum)
    if end_dim != len(x.shape):
        cum = 1
        for i in range(end_dim, len(x.shape)):
            cum = cum * x.shape[i]
        dims.append(cum)
    layer.param.reshape_param.shape.CopyFrom(caffe_net.pb.BlobShape(dim=dims))
    log.cnet.add_layer(layer)
    return x


torch.flatten = Rp(torch.flatten,_flatten)
```

### 6.2 Model evaluation of Pytorch 1.2 and earlier versions

If the `Pytorch` version is 1.2 or earlier, operators may not be supported when the `Pytorch` model is converted to the `onnx` model.  If the `upsample_bilinear2d` operator is not supported, you can upgrade the `Pytorch` version to 1.3 or later, or you can obtain `pytorch/torch/onnx/symbolic_opset10.py`, from the `Pytorch` official code library and copy it to the `Pytorch` installation directory.

### 6.3 Failed to find scripts such as model_convert.sh

There are many `shell` scripts in the evaluation service. The file format must be `unix`. If you have opened a file in Windows or converted the file when downloading the code, the file format may be changed to DOS. Pay attention to the file format.
