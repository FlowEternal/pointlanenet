# Auto-Lane

## 1. Algorithm Introduction

Lane information is the most important information of road structure, which is vital for the intelligent vehicle to drive in the restricted road area. Real-time lane detection is one of the most important procedure in intelligent vehicle assisted driving system work cycle, which is helpful to path planning, lane departure warning and accurate navigation. An end-to-end Lane architecture search algorithm, auto_lane is designed to cope with the problem that with a large amount of calculation overhead current lane detection models are lacking in practical applicable worth. The algorithm architecture is shown below：
![frame_work](../../images/auto_lane_frame_work.png)

auto_lane is composed of three components: backbone module, feature fusion module and head。The backbone module is mainly used to extract image features, feature fusion module is mainly used to fuse multi-level features, and head is used to decode the corresponding lane line. After end-to-end search, multiple candidate models can be obtained to meet the deployment requirements, then they can be selected and deployed according to the actual situation.

## 2. Application scenarios

This Algorithm is mainly designed for the application of automatic driving industry, such as the perception module of auxiliary driving / automatic driving system, AR navigation and high precision map aided drafting, etc.

## 3. Algorithm principle

1. the design of search algorithm

   Gradient-based search method, RL-based search method and EA-based search method are the main stream in the research field. Gradient-based search methods are fast but unreliable, and there is a big gap between search and final training. The RL-based search  methods requiring a large number of samples are inefficient in data utilization, which is not suitable for lane line detection. Auto_Lane uses the EA-based method to search for networks and encodes the network architecture based on experience. The algorithm generates the initial sample by using the random sampling method, the samples located at the Pareto frontier are selected to generate the child sample by using the evolution algorithm and the partial order pruning algorithm, after multiple generation of search, the candidate sample located on the Pareto front edge are obtained.

2. the design of search space

   - the search space of backbone

    The search space of backbone consists of two series: `ResNetVariantDet`and `ResNeXtVariantDet`，The two series have the same coding scheme but different block which is the atom structure of a model, The coding structure is described as follows.

    ![auto_lane_backbone](../../images/auto_lane_backbone.png)

    The preceding figure shows the model of  `basicblock 28 121-211-1111-12111`，`basicblock` indicates that the block used by the model is `basicblock`. `-` indicates that the model is divided into different stages based on the resolution. ，`1` indicates that the number of channels is not increased. `2` indicates that the number of channels is doubled.

   - the search space of feature fusion

    Based on experience and the validity of feature fusion, the following four model structures are provided: ['012-022', '012-122', '122-022', and '-']. The hyphen, `-` indicates that the feature fusion module is not used, which regard the output of phase 4 of the model as the input of the head. `['012-022', '012-122', '122-022']` indicates the true type structure. The following figure shows the model structure.

    ![auto_lane_neck](../../images/auto_lane_neck.png)

    The preceding figure shows the model structure of `012-022`. The detail of code scheme is described in the figure on the right.

3. evaluation function

   We use F1 of evaluation result on data set as evaluation function. Unlike the evaluation of solid object detection, lane is irregularly shaped which is pathological for evaluation. Bit-wise IoU is utilized as measure to judge whether a predict lane hit the ground truth or not. Given the cartesian product between the prediction set and the labeling set, The Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm is used to associate the prediction result with the labeling result. If the IoU of the corresponding pair is greater than 0.5, the association is successful. Otherwise, the association fails. Denote the number of instances that are successfully associated in the test set as TP. Denote the number of positive instances that are not correctly predicted in the test set  as FN. Denote the number of positive instances that are incorrectly predicted in the test set as FP.

4. search policy

   We adopt the multi-objective search strategy considering the model efficiency (measured by indicators such as inference time/FLOPs) and model performance (measured by F1) at the same time. Non-dominate sorting is used to construct a Pareto front to obtain a series of network structures optimal for multiple objectives.

   Before running this algorithm, be sure to read the [Installation Guide] (.. /user/install.md), [Deployment Guide] (.. /user/deployment.md), [Configuration Guide] (.. /user/config_reference.md), [Example reference](.. /user/examples.md) and confirm it.

   The `/nas/auto_lane.yml` configuration file that can be used to run the benchmark is provided here. Go to the `examples` directory and execute the following command to run the example:

    ```bash
    vega ./nas/auto_lane.yml -s b
    ```

2. How to set search algorithm parameter

   The search algorithm is a mixture of random sampling and evolution algorithm, which is controlled by the search_algorithm subtree in the configuration tree. The configuration items are as follows:

    ```yaml
        search_algorithm:
            type: AutoLaneNas        # Set the search algorithm
            codec: AutoLaneNasCodec  # Set the codec to be used
            random_ratio: 0.5        # Set the sampling ratio of random sampling to the total number of samples.
            num_mutate: 10           # Set Genetic Algebra for Genetic Algorithm
            max_sample: 100          # Set the maximum number of samples

    ```

3. How to set search space

     the search space provided by the algorithm composed of `backbone` and `neck`. The specific configurable content is as follows: 

     | component |                  module                  |
