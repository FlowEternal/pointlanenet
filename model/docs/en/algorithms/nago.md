# NAGO

## 1. Algorithm Introduction

[Neural Architecture Generator Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01395) (NAGO) casts NAS as a problem of finding the optimal network generator and proposes a new, hierarchical and graph-based search space capable of representing an extremely large variety of network types, yet only requiring few continuous hyper-parameters. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, enabling the effective use of Bayesian optimisation as a search strategy. At the same time, we expand the range of valid architectures, motivating a multi-objective learning approach.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Search Space

Our network search space is modelled as a hierarchical graph with three levels. At the top-level, we have a graph of cells. Each cell is itself represented by a mid-level graph. Similarly, each node in a cell is a graph of basic operations (`conv3x3`, `conv5x5`, etc.). This results in 3 sets of graph hyperparameters:
`X_{top}, X_{mid}, X_{bottom}`, each of which independently defines the graph generation model in each level.
Following [Xie et al. （2019）](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01569) we use the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model as the random graph generator for the top and bottom levels, with hyperparameters `X_{top}=[N_{t}, K_{t}, P_{t}]` and  `X_{bottom}=[N_{b}, K_{b}, P_{b}]`; and use the Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph generator for the middle level, with hyperparameters `X_{mid}=[N_{m}, P_{m}]`, to allow for the single-node case.

By varying the graph generator hyperparameters and thus the connectivity properties at each level, we can produce a extremely diverse range of architectures. For instance, if the top-level graph has 20 nodes arranged in a feed-forward configuration and the mid-level graph has a single node, then we obtain networks similar to those sampled from the DARTS search space. While if we fix the top-level graph to 3 nodes, the middle level to 1 and the bottom-level graph to 32, we can reproduce the search space from [（Xie et al.， 2019）](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01569).

### 2.2 Sample Architectures

### 2.3 Search Algorithm

Our proposed hierarchical graph-based search space allows us to represent a wide variety of neural architectures with a small number of continuous hyperparameters, making NAS amenable to a wide range of powerful BO methods. In this code package, we use the multi-fidelity [BOHB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01774) approach, which uses partial evaluations with smaller-than-full budget in order to exclude bad configurations early in the search process, thus saving resources to evaluate more promising configurations and speeding up optimisation.
 Given the same time constraint, BOHB evaluates many more configurations than conventional BO which evaluates all configurations with full budget. Please refer to `hpo.md` for more details on BOHB algorithm.

## 4. User Guide

### 4.1 Search Space Configuration

The search space of NAGO described above can be specified in the configuration file `nago.yml` as follows.

```yaml
search_space:
    type: SearchSpace
    hyperparameters:
        -   key: network.custom.G1_nodes
            type: INT
            range: [3, 10]
        -   key: network.custom.G1_K
            type: INT
            range: [2, 5]
        -   key: network.custom.G1_P
            type: FLOAT
            range: [0.1, 1.0]
        -   key: network.custom.G2_nodes
            type: INT
            range: [3, 10]
        -   key: network.custom.G2_P
            type: FLOAT
            range: [0.1, 1.0]
        -   key: network.custom.G3_nodes
            type: INT
            range: [3, 10]
        -   key: network.custom.G3_K
            type: INT
            range: [2, 5]
        -   key: network.custom.G3_P
            type: FLOAT
            range: [0.1, 1.0]
```

Note despite we are using the NAS pipeline, we define the search space following HPO pipeline format as we use BOHB to perform the search.
The exact code for the architecture generator (return a trainable PyTorch network model given a generator hyperparameter value) is `vega/networks/pytorch/customs/nago.py`.

### 4.2 Search Strategy

Our NAGO search space is amenable to any Bayesian optimisation search strategies. In this code package, we use BOHB to perform the optimisation and the configuration of BOHB needs to be specified in `nago.yml`. The example below defines a BOHB run with `eta=2` and `t=50` search iterations. The minimum and maxmimum training epochs used for evaluating a recommended configuration is 30 and 120 respectively.  

```yaml
search_algorithm:
    type: BohbHpo
    policy:
        total_epochs: -1
        repeat_times: 50
        num_samples: 350
        max_epochs: 120
        min_epochs: 30
        eta: 2
```

### 4.3 Run NAGO in VEGA

- Install and set-up vega following the [instruction](../user/install.md)
- Define the NAGO configuration file `nago.yml` as suggested above and put dataset at the `data_path` specified in `nago.yml`
- Run the command `vega ./nas/nago/nago.yml`

### 5. Output

The following two files are generated in the specified output directory (the default directory is `./example/tasks/<task id>/output/nas/`):

- The `output.csv` file contains the best architecture generator hyperparameters found by BOHB
- The `reports.csv` file contains all the architecture generator hyperparameters queried by BOHB at different epoch.
